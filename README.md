A Watchlist app to track the balance of different Bitcoin Cash addresses with the option to give each one a name!

Here is the live version of the project, deployed with Netlify: [BCH Watchlist](https://bch-watchlist.netlify.app/).

The app uses local storage to persist the watchlist data so it's still there next time you return.

An earlier version used cookies but that turned out to be an inefficient solution.
The change to localstorage caused watchlists to be forgotten once.

Made with [Mainnet.cash](https://mainnet.cash/).
