Here is the live version of the site, deployed with Netlify: [BCH Watchlist](https://bch-watchlist.netlify.app/).

App uses local storage to persist a watchlist of up to four Bitcoin Cash addresses.

Earlier version used cookies but that turned out to be an inefficient solution.
The change to localstorage caused watchlists to be forgotten once.

Made with [Mainnet.cash](https://mainnet.cash/).
